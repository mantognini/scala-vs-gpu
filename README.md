# Scala Parallel Collections VS GPU Frameworks

Bachelor Semester Project under the supervisions of LAMP at EPFL


## Abstract

Comparative benchmark of Scala Parallel Collections on CPU against collections on GPU based on technologies like C++AMP, CUDA, and others.


## Tasks

This Bachelor project is divided into the following tasks :
 1. Do a quick review of the tools provided by Scala Parallel Collections and how to benchmark a Scala application.
 2. Do some research on GPU technologies like CUDA, OpenCL, C++AMP, ...
 3. Select two GPU frameworks with a high level of abstraction and APIs relatively close to Scala’s.
 4. Find two real life applications written in Scala based on its parallel collections, probably based on other students’ Bachelor project.
 5. Rewrite those programs with the selected GPU frameworks.
 6. Benchmark the applications on different systems and find the weakness / strength of Scala and the GPU frameworks, such as execution time or code complexity.
